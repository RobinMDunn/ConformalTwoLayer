Title: Distribution-Free Prediction Sets for Two-Layer Hierarchical Data
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Robin Dunn <robin.dunn@novartis.com> 
Description: Constructs distribution-free prediction sets based on the methods in "Distribution-Free Prediction Sets with Two-Layer Hierarchical Models." We assume we have multiple observations in multiple subjects, in a hierarchical model setting. The methods address the following goals: unsupervised prediction of a new observation on a new subject, supervised prediction of a new observation on a new subject, and unsupervised prediction of a new observation on an existing subject.
